# Cardiovascular Disease dataset

Heart and blood vessel disease (also called heart disease) includes numerous problems,
many of which are related to a process called atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries. 
This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. 
If a blood clot forms, it can block the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke.
the  cardiovascular disease dataset is an open-source dataset found on Kaggle 

# About The Dataset:

The data was obtained from the kaggle website: 

https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset

The dataset Contains 70000
Rows and 11 Columns:

•	id: ID number

•	age: in days

•	gender: 1 - women, 2 - men

•	height: cm

•	wight: kg

•	ap_hi: Systolic blood pressure

•	ap_lo: Diastolic blood pressure

•	cholesterol: 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal

•	gluc: 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal

•	smoke: whether patient smokes or not


# Tools:

•	There are tools that will be used to achieve the goal of this project,
such as Jupyter notebook,Numpy,Matplotlib,pandas.

# Questions This Project Will Answered:

•	Is the one who smokes the most prone to heart disease?

•	More susceptible to heart disease, women or men?

•	Who's more likely to have heart disease?

•	How much is cholesterol in heart disease?

# TO DO:

•	Explore the data and come up with EDA phases then use a model to fit the data.

•	NOTE: the used features may be increased or changed and the model as well.
